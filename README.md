# MIPS-Converter
This repo contains all the codes and files required to make a basic MIPS to binary converter. This was done as a college project.

Temp Flow of program:

- [ ] Read lines from file
- [ ] Store each command in an array
- [ ] Use for loop to execute individual commands

- [ ] Split the command into parts
- [ ] Using dictionary get type of  mnemonic 
- [ ] According to mnemonic write in a string the separations of bits out of 32
- [ ] Take individual registers and put in a dictionary return a value int
- [ ] Put int to binary
- [ ] Add deficit digits(0) before the binary to make sufficiently long
- [ ] Concat all the stings to make a single 32 bit binary
